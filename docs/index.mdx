# Welcome to Todo CLI X

A command-line todo app built with Python — _created as a progressive learning project_.

![Todo CLI X](/images/screenshot.png)

While primarily designed as a way to explore and practice, it's also a **simple and minimalist tool** that anyone can use to manage tasks directly from the terminal.

Todo CLI X is a fully **open-source project** licensed under the MIT license. It’s designed for **learning**, **sharing**, and **evolving** — _contributions and feedback are always welcome!_
