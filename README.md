## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Learn Python through hands-on practice  
- Apply a clear and professional project methodology  
- Deepen understanding of core concepts (modules, functions, data structures, etc.)  
- Get introduced to modern tools in the Python ecosystem:  
  - `uv` for dependency management  
  - `pyproject.toml` for project configuration  
  - Unit testing  
  - `argparse` for command-line interfaces

---

## 🚀 Project Status

- ✅ Git repository initialized  
- ✅ Python environment managed with [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)  
- ✅ Project structure scaffolded  
- ✅ Core logic implemented (adding, listing, filtering, completing, deleting tasks)  
- ✅ Fully tested with `pytest`  
- ✅ Continuous Integration (CI) set up via GitHub Actions

```

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vidjinnangni/todo-cli.git
cd todo-cli
```

Set up the environment using uv:

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
```

## 📁 Task Storage

- All tasks are stored in a local file named `todo_data.json` (automatically created when needed).
- This file is **excluded from version control** (`.gitignore`) to avoid polluting the repository with user data.
- You can see an example of the file format in [`examples/todo_data.example.json`](examples/todo_data.example.json):

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "text": "Buy milk", "done": false },
  { "id": 2, "text": "Write documentation", "done": true }
]
```
